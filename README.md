# **CAC Admin Bot**

Cosmos Airdrops Chat **Improved Admin Bot** built with [Telegraf](https://telegraf.js.org/) in TypeScript. It provides excessively granular, advanced administrative features for managing the leading Cosmos Telegram group, including individual user restrictions, highly specific actions blacklisting, and arguably reckless role-based permissions.

## **Features**

- **Role Management**:
  - Supports `owner`, `admin`, `elevated`, and `pleb` roles.
  - Owners can promote admins and users to `elevated` role.
  - `Elevated admins` can promote users to `elevated` role.
  - `Elevated` users can manage certain bot functions but cannot assign roles.

- **User Restrictions**:
  - Restrict specific users from performing actions like:
    - Sending stickers or specific sticker packs.
    - Sharing URLs (globally or for specific domains).
    - Sending messages containing specific text patterns (via regex).
  - Restrictions can have expiration timestamps for temporary penalties.

- **Blacklist Management**:
  - Blacklist users to apply additional global restrictions.
  - View, add, and remove blacklisted users.

- **Global Action Management**:
  - Add or remove global restrictions affecting all users.

- **Violation Tracking**:
  - Log user violations and enforce penalties.
  - Enable users to view and pay fines (e.g., in JUNO tokens) to reduce penalties.

## **Installation**

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

3. Configure the bot token:
   - Add a `config.ts` file in the root directory:

     export const BOT_TOKEN = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN';
     ```

   - Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with your Telegram bot token.

4. Set up the SQLite database:

   ```bash
   yarn run setup-db
   ```

5. Start the bot:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
